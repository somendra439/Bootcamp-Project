These project helps to knowing basic concept of Data Structure and Algorithm in python.

BUILDING PHONEBOOK:

What it takes to execute this project:
- Use a data structure like an array, linked list, or hash table to store contact
records.
- Implement functions to add, remove, and search for contacts by name or
number.
- Use sorting algorithms like merge sort or quick sort to arrange contacts
alphabetically.
- Implement search algorithms like binary search or linear search for
efficient contact lookup.
- Consider using a tree data structure like a binary search tree or tire for
hierarchical organization.
- Implement persistence by saving and loading contacts from a file or
database.
- Utilize hashing techniques for efficient storage and retrieval of contact
records.
- Provide a user interface for adding, editing, deleting, and searching
contacts in the phonebook.
